00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
(upbeat music)
(air whooshing)

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.350
- The leaks are true.

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:05.970
I feel like I could start
every Pixel video this way

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.040
because they're always true.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.330
But I just got some hands-on time

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.120
with Google's new budget
phone, the Pixel 9a,

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:12.953
and right off the bat,

00:00:12.953 --> 00:00:14.700
there are a few things that
I'm really happy about.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.050
First of all, and most importantly,

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.360
the price stays the same at $499.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.780
So in a world where we have
questions about inflation

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.090
and tariffs and a whole
bunch of other variables,

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.350
this phone is the same
price that the Pixel 8a was.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:28.183
Nice.

00:00:28.183 --> 00:00:29.730
And then design-wise, okay,

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.050
I have mixed thoughts about this.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.150
So on one hand, it's pretty boring,

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.640
and I just really don't
find any of it that great.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.260
Like I feel like I just got done

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.000
praising the Pixel series last year

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.560
for stepping up their hardware game

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.420
with really locking in their identity

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.220
as the phone with the visor.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.890
Like you look at a
Pixel, it's recognizable.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.360
No other phone looks quite like it.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.660
And then this comes out, like
where did the identity go?

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.370
But on the other hand,
you'll notice something.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.460
There is no camera bump
on the back of this phone.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.010
Not just a little camera
bump or a small set of rings,

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.110
no, there's no camera bump, nothing.

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.350
And how long have we been
asking phone manufacturers

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.820
to do this?

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.867
Like you've seen the YouTube comments,

00:01:07.867 --> 00:01:10.080
"Hey, I don't care about a thin phone.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.690
Just go right ahead and
make the phone thicker,

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:13.920
get rid of the camera bump,

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.350
and fill in that extra
space with batteries."

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.080
And that's literally
exactly what they've done.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.390
It's an 8.9 millimeter thick phone,

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.490
and we have now the largest battery

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.420
that's ever been in a Pixel
device, 5,100 milliampere-hours.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.570
That's more than the 9 Pro XL just had.

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.850
So they did the thing, sick.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:33.930
So that by itself has essentially

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.870
become the main value
proposition to this new Pixel.

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.400
It's the cheaper one

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.550
with all the Pixely software
goodness we already know about

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.350
and the huge battery.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.070
Now the new embargo that
they're doing with this Pixel

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.280
for some reason is kind
of a massive red flag.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.910
They're not allowing us to
show any software at all,

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.350
like I usually do.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.720
So that's why this whole
video is just home screens.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.610
But I did get to spend
some time with this phone

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.690
and using it off camera,

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.220
and I can tell you pretty
much everything else

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.800
about it is exactly as you'd expect.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.050
It is powered by the same Tensor G4 chip

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.790
as the flagship Pixel 9s,

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:11.760
with 8 gigs of RAM and 128
gigs of starting storage.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.550
And it's also basically the
same size as the Pixel 9.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.550
So that's a 6.3 inch display
with the hole punch at the top

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.020
and the fingerprint
reader under the glass.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.810
And it honestly feels
very close to a flagship

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.160
in terms of build.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.790
It has flat aluminum rails.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.210
The back is plastic instead of glass.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.550
So you may notice that if
you're the rare breed of person

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:30.930
that doesn't have a case on their phone,

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.400
but also people argue
for that all the time

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.510
in terms of shadow resistance.

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.180
And this phone is also now fully IP 68,

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.920
dust and water resistant now,

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.590
unlike last year's 8a, which was IP 67.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.030
So here's what's interesting.

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.570
Last year, the Pixel 8a
came out at the same price

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.320
right around the time that the
Pixel 8 was all the way down

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.870
to like 550 bucks in price.

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.270
And it made too many sacrifices,

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.340
felt a bit off of a flagship phone.

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.600
So it was kind of in this awkward place

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.610
where it was not a very good deal.

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.490
And the Pixel 8 right above
it was a really good deal.

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.560
This year though, I feel like
there's been a massive push

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.120
actually in both directions.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.240
So the 9a is much closer to a flagship.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.710
It makes less of those sacrifices,

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.680
and it's the same price,
so it's a better deal.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.710
And the Pixel 9 is actually,
it was more pricey.

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.210
It was $799 at launch,

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.390
and so now it's down to like $649 at best.

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.040
So it's not as good of a deal.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.770
So there's enough separation
now between the two

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.380
where I'm not just telling
you to go buy the flagship.

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.770
The 9a actually represents
a good bang for the buck.

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.740
It seems to be almost the
same display as the Pixel 9,

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.290
same 120 hertz max refresh rate,

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.630
which, yes, is still off by default at 60,

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.440
but also same brightness, same resolution,

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.360
just a slightly worse contrast ratio.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.300
And it's Gorilla Glass
3 instead of Victus 2.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.071
And it isn't missing any
of the software features

00:03:50.071 --> 00:03:52.560
that make a Pixel a Pixel.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.930
So they might have gotten rid
of some of the hardware stuff,

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.300
but software-wise, all
that stuff is still there.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.342
Gemini is everywhere.

00:03:58.342 --> 00:04:02.220
Magic Eraser, photo
unblur, call screening.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.480
Like the stuff that I really miss

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.760
when I switch to another
phone that's not a Pixel,

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.980
it's all still in the A series,

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.840
and then still seven
years of software updates,

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.210
and the Pixel drops and all that stuff.

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:13.470
It still has basic Qi wireless charging,

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:14.940
and it's gonna charge that big battery

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.500
slower than the flagship, sure.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.660
But then also with these
dual cameras on the back,

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.880
it's a 48 megapixel main camera,

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.360
plus a 13 megapixel ultrawide,
and it still has night sight.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.730
So if I just take the
things that I think people

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.153
who are buying these types of
phones care the most about,

00:04:29.153 --> 00:04:31.380
you can think of the Pixel 9a basically

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.523
as like a Pixel 9,
minus some camera chops,

00:04:35.523 --> 00:04:38.311
plus a way bigger battery.

00:04:38.311 --> 00:04:40.140
And that's a sacrifice

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.850
I think a lot of people
are totally cool with,

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.050
and it's way cheaper.

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.460
So in general,

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:45.660
like are people really gonna notice

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.730
the plastic on the back versus glass,

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.620
or are they gonna notice
a slightly slower charging

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.420
when the battery's bigger?

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:52.500
You have a case on your phone anyway,

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.880
like I don't think that's
gonna be a huge deal

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:54.713
to a lot of people.

00:04:54.713 --> 00:04:55.950
So I think at this price,

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:58.140
it's actually pretty perfect positioning.

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:59.640
So there's four colors available again.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.110
Black and white are still here.

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.390
And there's also what
they're calling Peony,

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:05.550
which is this pink one, and Iris,

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.410
which is closer to like a purple or blue

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:08.790
depending on how the light hits it.

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.380
I think that's the one that looks best.

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:11.700
But now I'll leave you with this.

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.850
Okay, so good phone,
good price, good value.

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.190
I think they're in a good
place with the Pixel 9a,

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.440
but we are also a few months away

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.990
from starting to see
probably accurate leaks

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.050
of the Pixel 10 series.

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.340
And then the Pixel 10 is gonna come out,

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.740
and that obviously won't be
as cheap as the A series,

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.980
but the Pixel 10's shaping
up to be very interesting.

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.080
And I don't wanna overhype it,

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.350
because I feel like we could
easily be very disappointed,

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.450
but the rumors about Pixel 10,

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:42.990
some of them suggest a pretty
big performance increase

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.590
with Tensor G5, that could
make it much more fluid,

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:49.500
much more competitive
with Snapdragon stuff.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:50.580
And that's really interesting.

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.830
So if you're specifically a
person like me who's, you know,

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.500
maybe trying to maximize
performance per dollar

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:56.820
and who really cares
about that type of thing,

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.860
it might be worth waiting

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.606
for a potentially awesome Pixel 10.

00:06:01.606 --> 00:06:03.930
But I feel like I already regret

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:04.763
saying that in this video,

00:06:04.763 --> 00:06:07.140
because the 9a is a perfectly good phone.

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:08.970
You can definitely go get
that phone and be happy.

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:10.680
I just wanna be careful.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:11.850
I'm probably jinxing it.

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:15.150
I should just say expectations
are the thief of joy now,

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:16.530
just to get it out there.

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:18.780
But I'll be watching Pixel 10 stuff.

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:20.940
Either way, 9a drops into a world

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.360
where the iPhone 16e was
looking a little bit ridiculous,

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.680
and now we can feel validated.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.260
Calling it ridiculous because
we've got all these other

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.030
pretty good-looking
budget phones coming out.

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:31.860
So thanks, Google.
(chill music)

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:35.700
Also, this shirt is available
for a limited time now

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:39.281
while supplies last at shop.mkbhd.com.

00:06:39.281 --> 00:06:41.610
There's news on the horizon about this,

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:43.920
so get it while you can.

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.057
Thanks for watching.

00:06:45.057 --> 00:06:47.193
Catch you to the next one, peace.
